# Hockey Pool
A website to create and organize a fantasy pool for the NHL. Pick players, and see live stats of how your team is performing against your friends. Website is available [here](https://www.taharhidouani.com/projects/hockeypool/).

#### You can create a game with up to 24 friends and pick a custom game code.

#### Or you can load a previously created game.

#### Then pick up to 16 players, and the stats will update automatically. It will even let you know if that player is injured or playing tonight.
